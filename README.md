# ColorExtractionKMeans
- **Image Segmentation**
- Segmentation partitions an image into regions having similar visual appearance corresponding to parts of objects
- Here I have extracted the most dominant 'K' Colors using K-Means
- Then have applied K-Means and each pixel gets reassigned to the closest of the K Colors, leading to segmentation
